Click on the arrow in the corner on your desktop or, scoll down to the last option in hamburger-menu sign in the facebook app, to see the __Log&nbsp;Out__ button. That's it, right?

> _Technically yes, but unfortunately not quite._ 

You see, a casual ___'Let me use your phone in the confidence that you will log-it-out later for my benefit'___ causes a great __vulnerability__ in the impressive security that facebook provides. This is the human-problem with security systems and are the basis for many social engineering attacks. One of these attacks is impersonation or, identity theft.

It is quite serious but fortunately there are a couple of ways to get around it.(_thanks, Mark!_). We'll discuss two handy solutions __which will allow us to log out of all devices that are currently using a particular facebook account__ (NOTE: This will also log out anyone using the Messenger application, as it is directly dependent on facebook)

Please follow __ONE__ of the two possible solutions

1. __RESET ALL INSTANCES__
{{%notice note%}}_Use this method if you remember your Email-ID and mobile number that is associated with facebook. You'll need to have access to both your Email and Phone number, as facebook will be verifying you on that basis_
	{{%/notice%}}
	* In a PC, log out of any open instances of facebook and then Go to [`https://www.facebook.com/hacked`](https://www.facebook.com/hacked)
		* Click `My Account is Compromised`
		* Type Email Id or Phone Number associated with that account
		* Facebook should return with a page that has one(or multiple) suggestions. Choose the account you want to reset. Then Enter the recent password that you remember
		* Follow the steps to reset your account. If is fairly simple from this point onwards. If you answer all the questions satisfactority, you will receive an email to create a new password __and all people(and devices) currently logged-in to your account will be logged-out by force__

2. __MANUALLY KILL EXISTING LOGINS__
{{%notice note%}}_Use this step, if you are unsure(or, not confident) if you can recall your email/pw credentials._
{{%/notice%}}
	* Login to your account on a PC
	* Go to this link [`https://www.facebook.com/settings`](https://www.facebook.com/settings)
	* Click on the `Security and login` menu-option on the left.
	* On the second panel, you'll see a list of devices in which your account is(or, has been) active.
		* _INSTRUCTIONS BELOW:_
		{{%notice info%}}You will not be allowed to log out of the device that you are currently using. But, you can right click on the dotted option menu and log out of other suspicious devices that may be using your account.

	* This way, you'll be able to log out of other devices using your facebook/messenger account.
